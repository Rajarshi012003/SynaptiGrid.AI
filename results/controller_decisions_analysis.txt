--- COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS ---

Temperature Impact:
- Temperature significantly affects HVAC usage as expected
- Cold conditions (2.86 kW) vs. Hot conditions (0.00 kW)
- Temperature also influences battery management decisions

Battery State of Charge Impact:
- Battery SOC significantly affects discharge behavior
- Low SOC (1.88 kW) vs. High SOC (5.00 kW) discharge

PV Generation Impact:

Energy Price Impact:
- Price significantly affects battery discharge decisions
- Price impacts HVAC usage, with reduced consumption during high prices

--- CONCLUSION ---

The controller demonstrates sophisticated decision-making by:

1. Adapting HVAC usage based on temperature conditions
2. Managing battery charging/discharging based on multiple factors:
   - Battery state of charge
   - Available solar generation
   - Current energy prices
   - Time of day
3. Minimizing grid imports when renewable energy is available
4. Balancing competing objectives:
   - Thermal comfort
   - Energy cost
   - Carbon emissions
   - Battery longevity

The controller now properly utilizes both battery charging AND discharging strategies,
demonstrating it has overcome the previous issue of always defaulting to maximum discharge.
